-Met up with group to discuss how tasks were coming along. Minutes were sent. 13/02/18
-Investigated the Timeline object in Javafx. Found different methods that allow you to 
set actions when the timer is set to 0. Seems to work well when under stress (found prime
numbers between 1 to 100000 7 times in 5 minutes, timer still counted down on time. Used
Samsumg Clock Timer to check this, further checking can be done but may be arbitrary.) 15/02/18 2 Hours
